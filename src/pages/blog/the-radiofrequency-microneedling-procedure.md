Radiofrequency microneedling is a cosmetic treatment that uses radio frequency waves to rejuvenate the facial skin. The procedure targets and addresses common skin concerns such as acne scars and wrinkles.



Before the procedure, patients must consult with a cosmetic surgeon. This healthcare professional reviews and assesses patients' medical history, assesses their skin, and provides preparation instructions. Patients with active acne may need antibiotics, while those prone to cold sores may require antiviral medication.



Before the radiofrequency microneedling session, the healthcare provider cleans patients' skin with alcohol to prevent infections and applies topical or local anesthetics to numb the area and ensure comfort. The microneedling device creates tiny punctures in the skin while releasing radio frequency waves. Typically, the process lasts 10 to 20 minutes, depending on the treatment area size.



Afterward, the healthcare provider applies a growth solution to support the regeneration of cells and a soothing solution to ease discomfort. Patients can then go home and resume their daily activities with minimal downtime.
